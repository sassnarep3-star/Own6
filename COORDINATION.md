## Branch rule (deviation logged)

The session brief asked for `session-<id>/<task>` branches. The Arena session rule fixes this session to **`arena/05e359b8-own6`** and forbids creating other branches. All tasks below are therefore done on `arena/05e359b8-own6` by session `05e359b8`. Scopes are still kept non-overlapping by file so another session can take a task on its own branch.

## Task completion records

- **T1 Repo review** — Sources: repo tree and `git log` at commit `c5d6e4c`; GitHub Pages API. Verification: read every tracked file (only `README.md`). Irregularities: F07–F11 in `data/flags.json`.
- **T2 Korean law** — Sources: S1 (law.go.kr, read 2026-11-02; Arts. 2, 24, 26, 30, 47–49, 51, 53–54). Verification: each row's Korean excerpt was copied from the page text; English summaries are compiler translations and are labelled as such. Irregularities: F01, F02, F12.
- **T3 NBA schedule** — Sources: S2 (nba.com/schedule, Week 3, Monday Nov 2 block, read 2026-11-02). Verification: 15 games, IDs `0022600158`–`0022600172`, each matched to its nba.com preview link. Odds not captured. Irregularities: F04, F05.
- **T4 NBA policy** — Sources: S3, S4 (official); R1–R4 (press, unverified). Verification: official values taken only from S3 and S4. Restrictions reported by press are left blank and marked unverified. Irregularities: F03.
- **T5 Strategies and methodology** — Sources: none external; compiler methodology. Verification: no strategy or correlation value was produced because no verified odds or results dataset exists. Gates G1–G8 all open. Irregularities: F01, F04, F06.
- **T6 Site** — Sources: built from `data/*.json`. Verification: `scripts/check_site.py` (data rules + internal link check + https check). Result at build time: OK, 9 pages.
